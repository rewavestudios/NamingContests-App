<h2>App details</h2>

  <p>
Learn by doing!
Learn full-stack JavaScript development by building a web application with MongoDB, Node.js, and React.js.

Learn how to use Node as a web server and an API server,
how to consume data and build user interfaces with React,
and how to read and write data with a MongoDB database.

React allows you to build full-featured, data-driven applications faster and more efficiently than what is possible with JavaScript alone.

  Special thanks to instructor [Samer Buna](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/samer-buna), who introduces us to modern JavaScript programming concepts, with an emphasis on functional methods and open-source tools. The lessons are almost completely hands-on, with live coding demonstrations that bring the concepts home.
